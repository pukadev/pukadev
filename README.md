# Hello World! 🌍👋

I'm **@pukadev**, your friendly neighborhood coder with a penchant for memes and operating systems that probably shouldn't exist!

## Who Am I? 🤔

- **👀 Obsessed With:** Crafting Meme Operating Systems that defy logic and maybe even run! Our team's been dabbling in AI shenanigans for over 5 years—basically since dinosaurs roamed the earth (in tech years).

- **🌱 Currently Absorbing:** All the AI knowledge the internet will throw at me. Machine learning, deep learning, coffee learning—you name it!

- **💞️ Seeking Partners In Crime:** Looking to collaborate on Meme OS projects. If you've got a wild idea that makes people laugh and question reality, let's make it happen!

## Fun Tidbits 🎉

- **😄 Pronouns:** She/her—but "Meme Queen" has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

- **⚡ Fun Fact:** I'm a token too! (The non-fungible kind, but definitely fun-gible.)

## Let's Connect! 📡

- **📫 How to Reach Me:** Send a tweet-sized carrier pigeon over to [Twitter](#). Smoke signals and Morse code also accepted.

Feel free to dive into my repositories, open issues, or just say hi! Let's turn code into comedy gold together. 🚀😂
