Hello World! 🌍👋
I'm @pukadev, your friendly neighborhood coder with a penchant for memes and operating systems that probably shouldn't exist!

Who Am I? 🤔
👀 Obsessed With: Crafting Meme Operating Systems that defy logic and maybe even run! Our team's been dabbling in AI shenanigans for over 5 years—basically since dinosaurs roamed the earth (in tech years).

🌱 Currently Absorbing: All the AI knowledge the internet will throw at me. Machine learning, deep learning, coffee learning—you name it!

💞️ Seeking Partners In Crime: Looking to collaborate on Meme OS projects. If you've got a wild idea that makes people laugh and question reality, let's make it happen!

Fun Tidbits 🎉
😄 Pronouns: She/her—but "Meme Queen" has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

⚡ Fun Fact: I'm a token too! (The non-fungible kind, but definitely fun-gible.)

Let's Connect! 📡
📫 How to Reach Me: Send a tweet-sized carrier pigeon over to Twitter. Smoke signals and Morse code also accepted.
